          <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us by telephone, e-mail, fax, or in any other way. This includes information that can identify you, including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, and, in some cases, billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date), ("personal information"). We also may request information about your traveler preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions.</p>

          <p>When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through CheapAirHub, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing CheapAirHub with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.</p>

          <h4 class="head-deatilpage">Information from Other Sources</h4>
          <p>We also may periodically obtain information about you from our business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, which we use to correct our records and to facilitate proper delivery of travel information; and demographic information, which we use to better understand your potential purchasing preferences.</p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="head-deatilpage">Automatic Information</h4>

          <p>CheapAirHub may share your information with the following entities:</p>
          <p>Suppliers, such as hotel, airline, cruise, or car rental companies, or activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout CheapAirHub, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not share your email address with these suppliers unless they need it to fulfill the travel reservation you have made through CheapAirHub, and we restrict their use of this information to that purpose. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your other personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through CheapAirHub. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or to facilitate your travel reservation.</p>
          <p>Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, customer service, marketing, and fraud prevention. These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
          <p>Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners and recommend you evaluate their practices before deciding to provide your personal information.</p>
          <p>We also may share your information:</p>
          <p>In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</p>
          <p>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of CheapAirHub, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.</p>
          <p>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.</p>
          <p>We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors a Web site receives or what are the most popular vacation destinations.

          <h4 class="head-deatilpage">How we protect your information?</h4>
          <p>We want you to feel confident about using CheapAirHub to plan and purchase your travel, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no Web site can guarantee security, we have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.</p>

          <h4 class="head-deatilpage">Children's Privacy</h4>
          <p>CheapAirHub does not sell travel or other services for purchase by children. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.</p>
          <p>External Links</p>
          <p>If any part of the CheapAirHub Web site links you to other Web sites, those Web sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
